# xv6_color_changer
The goal of the homework is to modify the xv6 system so that it supports changing color of letters and background of the text in further typing.

Table appears with ALT+C, when the table is showing input to the console is disabled and you can only move through the table.
Moving through the table is done using the keys: w and s, specifically:

+ w - move up.
+ s - move down.

Selecting an item from the table is done by exiting (with ALT+C as well) the table, where the color combination of the selected row is applied.

## Running
You can start xv6 with command _**make qemu**_
